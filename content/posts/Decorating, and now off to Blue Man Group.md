Today has been a day of Decorating, relaxation, and now, we're going to leave to go see one of Bule Man Group's last shows in Chicago. I haven't been to Blue Man Group in around 7-8 years at this point I'm excited to see another show, and to get a different perspective this time around. Hopefully I don't freeze to death in the 20 degree weather! Anyway, Hope everyone's having a great day, and M shall see thee later.
