      <description>&lt;p&gt;Today has been a day of Decorating, relaxation, and now, we&amp;rsquo;re going to leave to go see one of Bule Man Group&amp;rsquo;s last shows in Chicago. I haven&amp;rsquo;t been to Blue Man Group in around 7-8 years at this point I&amp;rsquo;m excited to see another show, and to get a different perspective this time around. Hopefully I don&amp;rsquo;t freeze to death in the 20 degree weather! Anyway, Hope everyone&amp;rsquo;s having a great day, and M shall see thee later.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Happy Thanksgiving! As of today, (work in progress) HamricTriio: Access Edition has entered entered into an open-testing phase of development. Accessibility testing will be our next step, as the theme has been setup as close to HTML as possible, while still syncing with a notes application, called Obsidian. Posts from M, L, and A, are possible, along with shared posts from HamricTriio. There is also a Main version in the works of this site, designed for the visual users. The Current version, set to sync across both sites,  has been designed for the blind or visually impaired, making posts easily accessible to those using screen readers. In the mean time, stay tuned for more updates from HamricTriio. We have more coming!&lt;/p&gt;</description>
